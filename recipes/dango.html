        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Dango is a slightly sweet Japanese rice dumpling made from rice flour mixed with uruchi (non-sticky) rice flour and glutinous rice flour. The combination gives it a chewy texture. While it is primarily colourless and tasteless, you might find various flavors infused with ingredients to make the dough balls flavorful. Matcha and strawberry powder are popular. You may also find them at cafes in Japan served with a sweet sauce as a dip. Hanami dango is a sweet dessert that the Japanese eat during the sakura viewing season. The dessert is available in three colors: pink, pale green, and white, just like the cherry blossoms.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup Japanese rice flour</li>
            <li>3/4 sweet glutinous rice flour</li>
            <li>5 tbsp powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2/3 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 tsp matcha powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp water</li>
            <li>1 drop pink food coloring</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the rice flours and powdered sugar in a bowl. Stir in warm water while mixing. When the flour clumps together, start kneading until the dough is smooth. Then combine into one huge dough ball.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into three separate pieces. Then, for the hanami version, add one drop of pink food coloring into a single piece and work it to make a pink dough ball.</li>
            <li>Add the matcha powder to the other dough and work it into a green dough ball.</li>
            <li>Divide each dough ball into four equal balls. For a total of 12 balls. If the dough is cracking, apply a small amount of water to the broken area to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Boil a large pot of water on low heat. Once the water in the pot is boiling, gently drop in each dumpling. Then cook for about 1-2 minutes. Remove the dumplings when they rise to the top. Place the dumplings in iced water. Once cooled, drain well and transfer to a tray.</li>
            <li>Skewer three different colored pieces into a bamboo skewer.</li>
        </ol>
