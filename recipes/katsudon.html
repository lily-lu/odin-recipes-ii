        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Made by Yukihira in Food Wars, Katsudon is a bowl of rice topped with a deep-fried breaded beef cutlet, egg, and vegetables. The dish takes its name from the Japanese words katsu (for cutlet) and donburi (for rice bowl dish).</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <h5>Katsu</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ribeye steak</li>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Cornflour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Dashi and Katsudon Base</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>5g Kombu</li>
            <li>5g Bonito flakes</li>
            <li>1/4 cup light soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sake oe cooking wine</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>Steamed white rice</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h5>Dashi and Katsudon Base</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, add the water and kombu. Turn the heat to medium and bring this to the boil, removing the kombu just before the water is boiling (this prevents the dashi from becoming slimy and bitter).</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and add the bonito flakes. Allow the flakes 10 minutes to steep in the residual heat, then strain the dashi.</li>
            <li>Add the soy sauce, mirin, sake and white sugar. Stir to combine and reserve until needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Katsu</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim steaks of excess fat (if needed), then generously season on all sides with salt and pepper. Allow the meat to come up to room temperature and the salt to fully dissolve.</li>
            <li>Prepare your pane station. Combine 1  cup of all purpose flour with 1/2 a cup of cornflour in one dish. Beat two eggs with a splash of milk in a second dish. Pour 1 cup of panko bread crumbs into a third dish.</li>
            <li>Toss the steak in the combined flour dish, ensuring it’s fully coated. Transfer into the egg wash and coat thoroughly. Transfer back into the flour to coat, then back into the egg. Finally, transfer into panko breadcrumbs and ensure an even coating is achieved.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan, add vegetable oil and turn heat to medium-high. Test oil for temperature by dropping in one piece of panko. If it starts bubbling immediately, it’s ready. Gently lower in the beef and cook for 2.5 to 3 minutes per side for medium-rare, or to your preference.</li>
            <li>When the cutlet is cooked to your liking and well browned, remove it from the oil and allow it to drain on paper towel or a wire basket and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Assembly</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium frying pan, add 1 cup of the katsudon base. Add half of the thinly sliced onions and turn the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a steady simmer. Cover with a lid, and cook onions for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat 2 eggs and pour into the frying pan. Allow the eggs to cook for 30 seconds, or until just starting to set. Place the beef on top of the egg and sauce mixture. Cover with a lid and steam for 2 to 3 minutes or until the eggs are just set.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and gently pour the mixture over a bowl of white rice. Garnish with parsley.</li>
        </ol>
